# AI-Guided Demo Implementation Plan
*Updated: Fully Mocked AI for Demo Purposes*

## üéØ Revised Approach: Realistic Demo Implementation

Since this is for demo purposes with full mocking capabilities, we can implement a much more comprehensive AI experience that **looks and feels production-ready** while being entirely scripted.

## üé¨ Demo Experience Flow

### 1. AI-Guided Onboarding (3-4 minutes)
```
AI: "Hi! I'm your marketing assistant. Let's create your first campaign together. 
     What's your main goal today?"

[User selects: Promote Product]

AI: "Great choice! Product promotions work best with email campaigns. 
     What's your business website or name?"

[User types: "Tony's Tacos" or enters URL]

AI: "Perfect! I found your brand colors and style. Let me create a 
     professional email template for your taco promotion..."

[AI "generates" pre-made template with Tony's Tacos branding]

AI: "Here's your template! I've added your brand colors and suggested 
     content. Would you like me to help you customize the text?"
```

### 2. Smart Content Assistance
```
[User taps on headline block]

AI: "I can help with this headline. Based on your taco business, 
     here are some engaging options:
     
     ‚Ä¢ üåÆ Taco Tuesday Special - 20% Off!
     ‚Ä¢ New Menu Items You'll Love
     ‚Ä¢ Tony's Tacos: Fresh Daily Specials"

[User selects option 1]

AI: "Great choice! That headline has a 85% higher open rate 
     for restaurant promotions. Want me to suggest body text too?"
```

### 3. Mock Brand Intelligence
```
AI: "I analyzed your website and found:
     ‚Ä¢ Primary colors: Orange (#FF6B35) and Green (#2ECC71)
     ‚Ä¢ Logo style: Casual, hand-drawn
     ‚Ä¢ Voice: Friendly and approachable
     
     I've applied these to your email template. Does this look right?"

[Shows perfectly branded template]
```

### 4. Simulated Performance Insights
```
[After "sending" email]

AI: "Your email is performing great! Here's what I'm seeing:
     
     üìä 45% open rate (23% above average)
     üîó 12% click rate

  async generateResponse(context: string): Promise<string> {
    // Add 1-3 second delay to simulate AI thinking
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 + Math.random() * 2000));
    
    // Return contextually appropriate pre-written response
    return this.getContextualResponse(context);
  }
