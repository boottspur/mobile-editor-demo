# AI-Guided Onboarding Feature Analysis & Development Plan

## üìã Requirements Analysis

### Current State
- **Existing Demo**: Simple mobile email editor with templates, basic editing, and preview
- **Architecture**: React Native with Expo, basic document management, simple UI flows
- **Scope**: Email editing only, minimal onboarding

### Proposed Expansion (PRD_2.md)
- **AI-Guided Onboarding**: Chat-style AI assistant walking users through campaign creation
- **Multichannel Support**: Email, Social Posts, SMS, Surveys, Multichannel campaigns
- **Brand Intelligence**: URL scraping for logos, colors, fonts
- **Contact Management**: Manual entry, CSV import, integration connections
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live campaign performance with AI insights
- **Goal-Driven UX**: Campaign creation based on marketing objectives

## üö® Critical Analysis & Concerns

### Scope Expansion Impact
1. **10x Complexity Increase**: This transforms a simple email editor into a full marketing automation platform
2. **Demo vs Reality Gap**: Many features (AI, brand scraping, real integrations) would need heavy mocking
3. **User Confusion**: May dilute the core message about mobile email editing capabilities
4. **Development Time**: Estimated 4-6 weeks of development vs current focused demo

### Technical Challenges
1. **AI Integration**: Would need OpenAI API or extensive mocking system
2. **Brand Scraping**: Complex web scraping, CORS issues, URL validation
3. **Multiple Content Types**: SMS, Social, Survey require different editors and validation
4. **State Management**: Complex onboarding flow with multiple branching paths
5. **Real-time Data**: WebSocket simulation or complex polling systems

### Business Alignment Questions
1. **Core Value Prop**: Does this support or distract from the mobile email editing thesis?
2. **Demo Effectiveness**: Will stakeholders focus on AI/multichannel vs mobile editing quality?
3. **Resource Allocation**: Is this the highest value use of development time?

## üéØ Recommended Approach: Phased Integration

### Phase 0: Foundation Assessment
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Goal**: Determine if this aligns with core demo objectives

**Questions to Answer**:
- Does AI onboarding enhance or distract from mobile email editing showcase?
- Are stakeholders asking for multichannel or focusing on email editing quality?
- Would a simplified "AI assistant for email creation" be more focused?

### Phase 1: AI Assistant for Email (Focused Scope)
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Goal**: Add AI guidance to existing email creation flow

**Features**:
- Simple AI chat interface during email creation
- AI-suggested templates based on goals
- AI-generated content suggestions for existing email blocks
- Brand color suggestions (simplified, no scraping)
- Guided email creation flow

**Technical Approach**:
- Mock AI responses with realistic delays
- Simple state machine for AI conversation flow
- Enhance existing email editor with AI suggestions
- No new campaign types - focus on email excellence

### Phase 2: Contact Intelligence (If Phase 1 Success)
**Duration**: 1 week
**Goal**: Add smart contact management

**Features**:
- AI-guided contact import
- CSV parsing and validation
- Contact quality insights
- Send recommendations based on list

### Phase 3: Performance Intelligence (If Phases 1-2 Success)
**Duration**: 1 week
**Goal**: Add AI-powered campaign insights

**Features**:
- Simulated real-time performance data
- AI insights on campaign performance
- Suggested optimizations
- Next campaign recommendations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Considerations

### Current Architecture Strengths
- ‚úÖ Solid React Native + Expo foundation
- ‚úÖ Good component structure for email editing
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility proven
- ‚úÖ Clean state management for documents

### Required Architecture Changes
- **AI Service Layer**: Abstracted AI interface for easy mocking/real integration
- **Campaign Type System**: Extensible campaign type definitions
- **Enhanced State Management**: Complex onboarding flow state
- **Mock Data Infrastructure**: Sophisticated simulation systems
- **Content Generation**: AI-powered content creation for multiple formats

### New Component Structure (Phase 1)
```
/ai-onboarding/
  /components/
    - AIAssistant.tsx (chat interface)
    - GoalSelector.tsx (marketing objectives)
    - BrandSetup.tsx (simplified brand input)
    - ContentSuggestions.tsx (AI content recommendations)
    - GuidedEmailFlow.tsx (orchestrator)
  /services/
    - aiService.ts (mock AI responses)
    - brandIntelligence.ts (simple brand helpers)
    - contentGeneration.ts (template suggestions)
  /types/
    - aiTypes.ts (conversation, suggestions)
    - campaignTypes.ts (goals, objectives)
```
