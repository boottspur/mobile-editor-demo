## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### AI Service Layer
```typescript
// services/aiService.ts
interface AIService {
  generateResponse(context: ConversationContext): Promise<AIResponse>
  suggestTemplates(goal: MarketingGoal): Promise<Template[]>
  generateContent(blockType: BlockType, context: EmailContext): Promise<string[]>
  suggestColors(businessType?: string): Promise<ColorPalette[]>
}

// Mock implementation for demo
class MockAIService implements AIService {
  // Realistic response delays (1-3 seconds)
  // Pre-written responses based on context
  // Randomized suggestions for variety
}
```

### Conversation State Management
```typescript
// types/aiTypes.ts
interface ConversationContext {
  currentStep: OnboardingStep
  userGoal?: MarketingGoal
  businessName?: string
  emailContent?: Partial<EmailDocument>
  previousInteractions: ChatMessage[]
}

interface ChatMessage {
  id: string
  sender: 'ai' | 'user'
  content: string
  timestamp: Date
  suggestions?: UserAction[]
}
```

### Integration with Existing Email Editor
- AI panel slides in from side during editing
- AI suggestions appear as floating chips
- Seamless transition between AI guidance and manual editing
- Preserve all existing editor functionality

### Visual Design
- **Non-intrusive**: AI chat slides in/out, doesn't dominate screen

- **Mobile-optimized**: Touch-friendly interaction areas
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatible, clear contrast
