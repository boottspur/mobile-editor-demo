3. **Professional Output**: Generates clean, responsive HTML email code
4. **Modern Stack**: Latest React Native and Expo technologies
5. **Cloud-Enabled**: Seamless sync across devices with Supabase

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Marketing Manager on the Go
Sarah needs to review and edit the weekly newsletter while commuting. She opens the app on her phone, swipes to preview mode to see how it looks, makes quick text edits, and schedules it for sending.

### Scenario 2: Designer Crafting Templates
Alex uses the Design page to set brand colors and typography, then switches to Edit mode to build a reusable template with proper mobile optimization settings.

### Scenario 3: Quick Emergency Edit
The CEO spots a typo in an email about to go out. They tap the document name to rename it to "URGENT - Fixed Version", make the correction, and save - all in under 30 seconds.
