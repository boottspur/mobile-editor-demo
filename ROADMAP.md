# Mobile Email Editor Demo - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
A cross-platform mobile email editor demo showcasing how a single React Native codebase can deliver optimal experiences across desktop web, mobile web, and native mobile contexts.

## Technical Decisions & Clarifications

### 1. WYSIWYG Editor Implementation Strategy
**Decision**: Build a custom React Native-based editor using native components.

**Approach**:
- Use React Native core components (View, Text, Image, TouchableOpacity)
- Implement drag-and-drop with react-native-gesture-handler
- Create a unified component library that works on both web and native
- Focus on demonstrating single codebase benefits

**Benefits**: 
- True write-once experience
- No WebView complexity
- Better performance on native
- Clear demonstration of cross-platform capabilities

### 2. Document Storage Architecture
**Challenge**: Assets directory is read-only in production builds.

**Solution**: 
- Bundle 3 demo documents as JSON files in assets (read-only)
- Use Expo FileSystem API for user-created documents:
  - Native: `${FileSystem.documentDirectory}documents/`
  - Web: localStorage with 5MB limit awareness
- Implement a unified DocumentStorage service with platform-specific implementations

### 3. Distribution Strategy
**Native Distribution**: Expo Go via EAS Update
- **Requirement**: Demo must be accessible globally via Expo Go at any time without manual server running
- **Approach**: Use EAS Update to publish to Expo's servers
- Users install Expo Go once
- Access via permanent URL: `exp://u.expo.dev/update/[update-id]`
- QR code provides instant access from anywhere in the world
- Deep linking works within Expo Go environment

**Web Deployment**: Static hosting on Vercel/Netlify
- Short, memorable URL for easy access
- Mobile-optimized experience
- Seamless handoff to Expo Go via EAS Update URL

**Important**: The app must be designed to work with EAS Update constraints:
- All assets must be bundled or hosted externally
- Environment-specific configs must use EAS Update variables
- Updates must be tested in Expo Go before publishing

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Custom Editor Complexity**: Keep editor features focused on demo needs
2. **Performance on Low-End Devices**: Implement lazy loading and virtualization
3. **Expo Go Limitations**: Test early to ensure all features work within Expo Go

### Technical Debt Accepted for Demo
- No automated tests (not required for demo)
- Simplified error handling
- Basic accessibility support
- Limited offline capabilities
- Editor features focused on demonstration value
