# Mobile Email Editor Demo - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
A cross-platform mobile email editor demo showcasing how a single React Native codebase can deliver optimal experiences across desktop web, mobile web, and native mobile contexts.

## Technical Decisions & Clarifications

### 1. WYSIWYG Editor Implementation Strategy
**Decision**: Build a custom React Native-based editor using native components.

**Approach**:
- Use React Native core components (View, Text, Image, TouchableOpacity)
- Implement drag-and-drop with react-native-gesture-handler
- Create a unified component library that works on both web and native
- Focus on demonstrating single codebase benefits

**Benefits**: 
- True write-once experience
- No WebView complexity
- Better performance on native
- Clear demonstration of cross-platform capabilities

### 2. Document Storage Architecture
**Challenge**: Assets directory is read-only in production builds.

**Solution**: 
- Bundle 3 demo documents as JSON files in assets (read-only)
- Use Expo FileSystem API for user-created documents:
  - Native: `${FileSystem.documentDirectory}documents/`
  - Web: localStorage with 5MB limit awareness
- Implement a unified DocumentStorage service with platform-specific implementations

### 3. Distribution Strategy
**Native Distribution**: Expo Go via EAS Update
- **Requirement**: Demo must be accessible globally via Expo Go at any time without manual server running
- **Approach**: Use EAS Update to publish to Expo's servers
- Users install Expo Go once
- Access via permanent URL: `exp://u.expo.dev/update/[update-id]`
- QR code provides instant access from anywhere in the world
- Deep linking works within Expo Go environment

**Web Deployment**: Static hosting on Vercel/Netlify
- Short, memorable URL for easy access
- Mobile-optimized experience
- Seamless handoff to Expo Go via EAS Update URL

**Important**: The app must be designed to work with EAS Update constraints:
- All assets must be bundled or hosted externally
- Environment-specific configs must use EAS Update variables
- Updates must be tested in Expo Go before publishing

## Development Phases

### Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundation (Day 1)
- [x] Review PRD and identify concerns
- [ ] Initialize Expo project with TypeScript template
- [ ] Set up project structure and directories
- [ ] Configure TypeScript and ESLint
- [ ] Install core dependencies
- [ ] Set up git repository (if needed)

### Phase 1: Context Detection & Routing (Day 2)
- [ ] Implement context detection system
- [ ] Create AppShell component with context routing
- [ ] Build DesktopPlaceholder component
- [ ] Set up navigation structure
- [ ] Add URL parameter override for demo purposes
- [ ] Test on multiple devices/browsers

### Phase 2: Document Management System (Day 3)
- [ ] Design document schema and interfaces
- [ ] Implement DocumentStorage service
- [ ] Create bundled demo documents
- [ ] Build document listing UI
- [ ] Add create/read/update/delete operations
- [ ] Test cross-platform persistence

### Phase 3: Email Editor Core (Days 4-6)
- [ ] Build custom WYSIWYG editor framework with React Native components
- [ ] Implement Container block component (View-based)
- [ ] Implement Text block component (Text-based with inline editing)
- [ ] Implement Image block component (Image with picker)
- [ ] Add selection system with visual indicators
- [ ] Create unified property panels (same code for web/native)
- [ ] Build mobile-optimized floating toolbar

### Phase 4: Editor Interactions (Days 7-8)
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop (or tap-to-add) for blocks
- [ ] Add block reordering functionality
- [ ] Build property editors for each block type
- [ ] Implement undo/redo system
- [ ] Add save functionality with visual feedback
- [ ] Optimize touch interactions

### Phase 5: Platform-Specific Features (Day 9)
- [ ] Implement NativeAppBanner for mobile web
- [ ] Configure deep linking
- [ ] Add "Open in App" functionality
- [ ] Handle Expo Go detection
- [ ] Test state preservation across transitions

### Phase 6: Polish & Optimization (Day 10)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Animation improvements
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Final UI polish

### Phase 7: Testing & Documentation (Day 11)
- [ ] Manual testing across all platforms
- [ ] Document known limitations
- [ ] Create demo script
- [ ] Record demo video
- [ ] Update README with setup instructions

### Phase 8: Deployment (Day 12)
- [ ] Login to EAS: `eas login`
- [ ] Configure EAS Update: `eas update:configure`
- [ ] Build and publish to EAS Update:
  - [ ] Create production update: `eas update --branch production --message "Demo release"`
  - [ ] Get permanent Expo Go URL from EAS dashboard
- [ ] Deploy web version to Vercel/Netlify
- [ ] Generate QR codes for both web and Expo Go URLs
- [ ] Test global access:
  - [ ] Different networks/locations
  - [ ] Expo Go app on various devices
  - [ ] Web-to-native handoff with EAS Update URL
- [ ] Document the permanent URLs for distribution

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Custom Editor Complexity**: Keep editor features focused on demo needs
2. **Performance on Low-End Devices**: Implement lazy loading and virtualization
3. **Expo Go Limitations**: Test early to ensure all features work within Expo Go

### Technical Debt Accepted for Demo
- No automated tests (not required for demo)
- Simplified error handling
- Basic accessibility support
- Limited offline capabilities
- Editor features focused on demonstration value

## Success Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Desktop shows appropriate placeholder
- [ ] Mobile web has full editor functionality
- [ ] Native app works without banner
- [ ] Documents persist across sessions
- [ ] Smooth transition from web to native
- [ ] Sub-2-second context switching
- [ ] Touch-friendly interface with 44px+ targets
- [ ] Demo flow works end-to-end

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Editor approach confirmed: Custom React Native components
2. ✅ Distribution confirmed: Expo Go for native, web deployment for mobile web
3. ✅ Testing confirmed: No automated tests needed
4. Ready to begin Phase 0 implementation

## Timeline
**Total Duration**: 12 working days
**Daily Standups**: Review progress against roadmap
**Flexibility**: ±2 days for unforeseen challenges
